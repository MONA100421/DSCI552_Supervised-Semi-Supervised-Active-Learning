# 🧠 Supervised, Semi-Supervised & Active Learning (DSCI 552 - HW8)

Perfect-score (100/100) project for **Machine Learning (DSCI 552)** @ USC.  
This assignment compared **supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised, and active learning** methods on real-world datasets.

---

## 🚀 Highlights
- **Supervised**: L1-penalized SVMs with normalized features + 5-fold CV.  
- **Semi-Supervised**: Self-training with margin-based unlabeled selection.  
- **Unsupervised**: K-Means & Spectral Clustering with majority voting.  
- **Active Learning**: SVM uncertainty sampling vs Passive random sampling.  
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: 30–50 runs for stable error estimates.  

---

## 📊 Results
- **Supervised SVMs** gave strongest baselines.  
- **Semi-Supervised** improved when labeled data was scarce.  
- **Active Learning** outperformed Passive — reaching low error with fewer labels.  
- **Unsupervised** underperformed but revealed meaningful data structures.
